# Housing Price Prediction
#### ADS500B Final Team Project
#### Team 5: Lorena Dorado and Tysir Shehadey

## Introduction
Predicting housing prices and understanding human behavior are essential for advising clients to a successful home buying journey. There are many attributes that are correlated to sale price. The dataset used for this analysis contains details of house sales of King County in Washington State. The data represents houses sold between May 2014 and May 2015. With supervised learning, we can predict home prices based on prior records.

## Data

## Objective
The goal of thie project is to produce data-backed predictions on housing prices for our clients. The team performs exploratory data analysis to understanded the housing features that affect price using python.

Response Variable: `Price`

Exploratory Variables: `sqft_living`, `grade`, `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, and `yr_built`
